# eSense Flutter Example

Demonstrates how to use the `esense_flutter` plugin. 
See the [`main.dart`](https://github.com/cph-cachet/flutter-plugins/blob/master/packages/esense_flutter/example/lib/main.dart) for the main application.

Make sure that the eSense device is paired and connected to the phone via Bluetooth **before** running this app. The app assumes that it can connect to the device on start up and does not demonstrate how this is done.
