## Setup
### Apple HealthKit
Step 1: Append the Info.plist with the following 2 entries 
```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
```

Step 2: Enable "HealthKit" inside the "Capabilities" tab.

### Google Fit
Follow [this setup](https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-started). 

### Android X
Replace the content of the `android/gradle.properties` file with the following lines:

```bash
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M
android.enableJetifier=true
android.useAndroidX=true
```

## Usage
Below is a snippet from the `example app` showing the plugin in use.


### Check authorization
The following example shows prompting the user for authorization to the API, which is necessary in order to fetch any data. 

Calls to fetch data from the API should be done within the inner if-clause.

```dart
Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () async {
    _isAuthorized = await Health.requestAuthorization();
    if (_isAuthorized) {
        /// Do something with the API here
    }
}
```
### Specify data type
Data types indicate the type of data to fetch from the API and are available from the enum class `HealthDataType`. 

Below is an example of a few data types:

```dart
List<HealthDataType> types = [
        HealthDataType.WEIGHT,
        HealthDataType.HEIGHT,
        HealthDataType.STEPS,
    ];
```
For an overview of all data types see the table in __Data Types__ section above.

### Check if data type available
Not all data types are available on both platforms. In order to check whether or not a data type is available for the current platform, 

```dart
bool weightAvailable = Health.isDataTypeAvailable(HealthDataType.WEIGHT);
```

### Fetch data for a given type
Given the list of data types (`types`) we can now fetch all the data, for each data type with a call to the `Health.getHealthDataFromType` function.

This call must be inside a try catch block, since when some data type is not available, an exception will be thrown. 
Also, make sure the access to the API has been authorized (see __Check authorization__).

```dart
List<HealthDataPoint> healthDataList = List<HealthDataPoint>();

for (HealthDataType type in types) {
    /// Calls to 'Health.getHealthDataFromType' must be wrapped in a try catch block.
    try {
        List<HealthDataPoint> healthData = await Health.getHealthDataFromType(startDate, endDate, type);
        healthDataList.addAll(healthData);
    } catch (exception) {
        print(exception.toString());
    }
}
```
